# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Students will learn how to build and deploy RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework. This assignment will introduce them to creating endpoints, handling requests, and returning responses in a Python-based web application.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Setting up FastAPI

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and create a basic endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.
- Create a FastAPI app with at least one endpoint (`/`) that returns a JSON response with a welcome message.
- Run the application locally using Uvicorn.

### 🛠️ Task 2: Building CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Create endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., `items`) to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a data model for the resource using Pydantic.
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the resource.
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

### 🛠️ Task 3: Adding Validation and Error Handling

#### Description
Enhance the API by adding input validation and error handling.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Validate incoming data using Pydantic models.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid requests.
- Handle exceptions gracefully.

### 🛠️ Task 4: Documentation and Testing

#### Description
Document the API and write tests to ensure its functionality.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use FastAPI's built-in documentation (Swagger UI) to document the API.
- Write unit tests for each endpoint using a testing framework like pytest.
- Ensure all tests pass successfully.
